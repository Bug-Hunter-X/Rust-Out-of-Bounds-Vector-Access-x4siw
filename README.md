This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: accessing an element in a vector using an index that is out of bounds. The `bug.rs` file contains the buggy code, which will panic at runtime. The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version that uses safe indexing methods to prevent the panic.
